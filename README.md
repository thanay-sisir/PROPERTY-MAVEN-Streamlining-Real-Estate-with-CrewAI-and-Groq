The retail property analysis system developed in this project demonstrates the application of autonomous AI agents to identify promising investment opportunities. By integrating real-time web search capabilities via SerperDevTool and advanced natural language processing with Groq’s Mixtral model, the system delivers comprehensive market insights and financial projections. While the system excels in synthesizing complex data, ongoing improvements aim to enhance real-time data integration and scalability.

## METHODOLOGY

This project utilizes a simulated real estate dataset and web-sourced data (via SerperDevTool) due to limited access to proprietary real estate databases. The methodology focuses on two key agents:

1. **Senior Retail Property Investment Analyst**:
   - Identifies top retail investment locations (e.g., 5 areas in Khammam, Telangana).
   - Analyzes foot traffic, accessibility, market trends, and ROI potential.
   - Combines quantitative metrics (e.g., rental yields, cap rates) with qualitative insights (e.g., emerging corridors).

2. **Senior Investment Property Research Analyst**:
   - Synthesizes research into concise, investor-focused reports.
   - Performs financial modeling (ROI, cash flow) and risk assessment.

Key features analyzed include:
- Location demographics
- Rental yields and vacancy rates
- Property appreciation potential
- Market competition and e-commerce impact

Irrelevant or redundant data is filtered out to optimize agent performance and report clarity.
